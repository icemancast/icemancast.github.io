bio: |
  I have been doing design and web application development work for over 15 years. I enjoy solving hard problems with code and have worked with various frameworks/libraries and languages; Kohana framework, PHP, MySQL, CSS, Sass, Capistrano, Git, Jquery, Emberjs and Wordpress just to name a few. My current framework development is Laravel, Reactjs and Wordpress. I am also in the process of releasing my first iOS application for a client written solely in React Native.
