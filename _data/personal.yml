bio: > # I have been doing design and web application development work for over 15 years. I enjoy solving hard problems with code. Yeah it makes me beat my forehead against the screen but after doing so I come across wonderful solutions. I have worked with various frameworks/libraries and languages; Kohana framework, PHP, MySQL, CSS, Sass, Capistrano, Git, Jquery, Emberjs and Wordpress just to name a few. My current lamp development environment is Laravel (php MVC framework) and Wordpress on a vagrant virtual box.
