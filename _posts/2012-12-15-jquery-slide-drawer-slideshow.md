I worked on a project where I needed a "drawer" for additional nav but I did not want it to take up the bottom of the screen. I made this full screen jQuery slideshow with jQuery slide drawer. The slide drawer slides down after about 7 seconds. After it slides down it can toggle back and forth from full height to hidden.
