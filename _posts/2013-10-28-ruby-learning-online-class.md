About 4 weeks ago I started an online Ruby course. At first when I
purchased the course I didn't think it was going to be intense. I
thought here is another course that I can take when I have a chance to
get to it. Right away the instructor IM me and hence started my roller
coaster ride of learning, reading and doing paired programming via
google hang out. Another plus to the course was that the instructor
teaches all in vim. I've used vim before but not to this extent. Now I
haven't looked back for my IDE of choice. This has been updated via vim
\:). Visit the course below and take a look at my git repo of practices
and assignments.
