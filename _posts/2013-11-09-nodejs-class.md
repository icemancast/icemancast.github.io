I started a 3 week course on node.js. I never really thought to learn it
before thinking it was framework like emberjs and I would not have any
need for it. After the first class I think I changed my mind. "One stack
to rule them; all the new applications in PayPal are now being built
using Node.js." as quoted by the article below. Our next class will be
going over express which is a web application framework for node. After
I have some cool stuff to show I will post it here. Having a blast :)
