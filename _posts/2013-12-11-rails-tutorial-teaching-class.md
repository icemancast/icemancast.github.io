So just last month I committed to helping teach a Ruby on Rails class.
You have to understand that I started learning Ruby and Rails early this
year (about January). I am following the idea that in order to grasp
something really well then you have to teach it. For the Rails class we
will be going through the [Ruby On Rails Tutorial by Michael
Hartl](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/). This was the tutorial that I
started with at the beginning of the year but only made it to chapter 7
then got too busy to continue. So making the commitment to teach has
sealed my future to finishing this course. This time around I will not
be copying and pasting but yet typing all script code by hand to commit
most of it to memory. As far as my Ruby course I have 2 weeks to finish
then will complete it :). The one out of many things that I want to pick
up this time is test driven development. Wish me well in my journey!
