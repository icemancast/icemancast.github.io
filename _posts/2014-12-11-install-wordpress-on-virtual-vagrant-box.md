I was asked by some of the students that I teach to give instructions on how I install wordpress on my local development box. I have a vagrant box machine that runs
ubuntu 14 on it and that is provisioned by ansible. After messing around for a bit I was able to come up with a solution. Even better yet I did a quick 5ish minute
video that walks you through the process. Enjoy
