A good designer friend of mine did an awesome job on the design of
this front page while I worked on the front end code for it. It
was my first time using parallax and after reading up on it I found
the [Stellar](http://markdalgleish.com/projects/stellar.js, "Parallax") package to be the
easiest entrace for it. I wanted to keep the scrolling effect sublte
but slick. I also did some jQuery work to make the nav sticky once
you scrolled past it.
