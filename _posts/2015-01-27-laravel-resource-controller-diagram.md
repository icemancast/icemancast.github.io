During a classroom lesson that I was giving my students I started whiteboarding
how the resource controllers works inside of Laravel. Also how the http verbs map
to each action/method inside of that controller. After working through it I had
what looked like a great diagram to share with anyone and everyone. This diagram
uses a posts controller like in a blog application for example.
