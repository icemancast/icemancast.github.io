## Full Stack Web Developer

I have been doing design, web design and web development work for over
10 years. I enjoy writing, creating and debugging code. I get a
satisfaction when all the pieces of a development project come together.
I have worked with various technologies and languages; Kohana framework,
PHP, MySQL, CSS, Sass, Capistrano, Git and Wordpress just to name a few.
My current lamp development environment is Laravel (php MVC framework) on a
vagrant virtual box.

Please view my work and feel free to contact me.
