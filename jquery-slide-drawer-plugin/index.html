title: JQuery Slide Drawer Plugin
---

<p>The jQuery Slide Drawer was created from a script I started for a website. I had a full screen slideshow for that website (<a href="http://projects.icastwork.com/slidedrawer/">see first script</a>) and wanted the bottom navigation to show and then go away so the user knew something was there.</p>

<p>The plugin has several settings that allow for the drawer to remain static and just toggle, to go away after a set amount of seconds and the speed at which is moves. Read full install and settings on github.</p>
